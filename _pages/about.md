I am currently an PhD Student fellow in the Host-Pathogen-Environment Interactions ([IHPE](http://ihpe.univ-perp.fr/en/)) research group at the University of Montpellier ([UM](https://www.umontpellier.fr/university-of-montpellier)). `JDLab` is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and share some of my analysis on some subject of interest.

I was born and grew up in France, I had the opportunity to study a lot of fields when I studied in Paris. I started with biochemistry where I found a passion for organ chemistry, then I realized that a ribosome is more efficient than a chemist. I then turned to biology and particularly virology and immunology. During my last year I followed courses at the Pasteur Institute where I discovered the possibility offered by bioinformatics. Here I am now in the last year of my bioinformatics thesis. My main interest is to assess the viral genetic diversity of an herpesvirus, OsHV-1, during Pacific Oyster mortality syndrome.

In my free time (Although this concept is relataif when we do a PhD), I enjoy writing code for myself to satisfy my own intellectual curiosity as well as to develop valuable IT skills through project learning, go skating, jogging, painting, and of course, hang out with my friends.

I hope that you will find information which will help through the various articles of blogs which I will publish.
