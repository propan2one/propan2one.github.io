# Welcome !

Hi, my name is Jean, I'm a PhD student in the Host-Pathogen-Environment Interactions ([IHPE](http://ihpe.univ-perp.fr/en/)) research group. This laboratory depends on several institutions, whose the University of Montpellier ([UM](https://www.umontpellier.fr/university-of-montpellier)) and the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea ([IFRMER](https://wwz.ifremer.fr/en/The-Institute)). Before Joining the [IHPE team](http://ihpe.univ-perp.fr/en/), I studied in the circulation of T Lymphocytes in the Secondary lymphoïd Organs using flow cytometry at the [Cochin Institut](https://www.institutcochin.fr/?set_language=en).

Now, my research focuses on the diversity of viruses inside [Crassostrea gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster). Specifically, I develop bioinfomatics pipeline and tools to explore the oysters [virome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virome), determine if some viruses are residents in oysters and how they influences the health of their hosts. In addition, I study one particular virus : the *Ostreid Herpes virus-1* (OsHV-1) which has massively decimated juvenile molluscs since 2008. I'm trying to understand what is the dynamics of viral populations during epidemics.

Before I started my PhD, I was studying Immunolgy at the [Paris Diderot University](https://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/). I decided to switch to bioinfomatics, and now i'm practitcing a lot to improve my comptetence in this field and data-science.
