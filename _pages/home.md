Hi! My name is Jean Delmotte, I'm a PhD student working in Montpellier university (France).  I'm interested in understanding genetic diversity of viruses, transcriptomic and genomic analysis, viral quasi-species impact on immune responses and population structure heterogeneity, particularly in the context of host-pathogens interaction within oysters. I also used the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language. I develop data analyis approaches on long and short reads sequencing to allow me and the scientific community to exploit large-scale genomic data to answer these basic science questions.

Thanks for visiting my blog. You can find me on social media [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DrStagiaire), be free to ask question I will be glad to answer if I can.
